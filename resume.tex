}
\cventry{2016}{Complete redesign of ad feed system}{}{\url{https://www.realtruck.com}}{}{
	Was put in charge of a system described as "the worst part of our codebase". Bugs in this system routinely caused the loss of tens of thousands of dollars. Maintaining, improving and testing this system while balancing time and priorities of other tasks, was described by management as a "master class in incremental improvement". The system can now be easily modified with little risk of side effects or failure, and can be plugged into arbitrary web technologies for consumption by advertising partners.
