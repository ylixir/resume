\opening{To whom it may concern:}
I am poor and in need of some income. I'm also a huge computer nerd and as a result know quite a lot about quite a lot of areas that relate to computers and gadgets. As you need employees (or so the posters claim) and I need money, I think we can help one another out.

If you wish to see a portfolio or whatever of things I've worked on, you may try googling my handle: ylixir. I'm the only one there is, so anything on github or Google code or anywhere else is me.
\closing{Regards,}
\end{letter}
