\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

When I see something good I like to take a moment to appreciate that thing.
I like to look at it from all the angles and see how it differs from other things.
I love to contrast it with all the other things that aren't good.
That way I can really appreciate what makes a thing special.
Then I like to compare it with other things that are good.

This part is the thing that really drives me.
There is no perfect idea, and therein lies the beauty of a good idea.
One can take a good idea and make it better.
One can bring a good idea to another and be taught how to make it better.
One can be brought a good idea and teach how to make it better.

There is one term in particular that drives me out of my mind. This term is "best practices".
This term is often used to avoid examining what makes a thing good and what could make it better.
Ignoring wisdom is never smart, and sometimes one stumbles when trying to improve.
The thing is...one can never rise above the status quo by being the status quo.

That is why I have come to you.
I hope that together we can rise above the status quo and create new better things.
