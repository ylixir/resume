\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

I have chosen to build a career in software engineering because it offers limitless room for growth.
In this field I am always learning new ideas along with new ways to apply those things.
Not only that, but there is great opportunity to teach and learn from my peers.
I would like to take a moment and talk about my approach to learning and improvement.

When I see something good I like to take a moment to appreciate that thing.
I like to look at it from all the angles and see how it differs from other things.
I love to contrast it with all the other things that aren't good.
That way I can really appreciate what makes a thing special.
Then I like to compare it with other things that are good.

This comparison is the thing that really drives me.
There is no perfect idea, and therein lies the beauty of a good idea.
Any idea can be made better. This improvement might be through hard work,
with time and reflection, or through mentorship.

I never avoid examining what makes a thing good and what could make it better.
Ignoring conventional wisdom is never smart, and sometimes one stumbles when trying to improve.
The thing is...one can never rise above the status quo by being the status quo.

That is why I have come to you.
I hope that together we can rise above the status quo and create new better things.
